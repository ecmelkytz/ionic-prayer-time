```javascript

angular.module('starter', ['ionic', 'ionic-modal-select'])

```

And you're ready to go.


## Directives

### modal-select

This directive will transform the element into a modal select: when clicking the element a select dialog will be open, with options presented in a clickable list. Once the user clicks on an option, it will be set on the bound model.

For this to work the following conditions must apply:

* The element you use this directive must be clickable.
* The directive requires ngModel to be set on the element
* The directive expects an inner element of class "option" to define the options template

The final value bound to your model will be determined as follow:

* if you set the attribute `option-getter` will be set as `getterFunction(selectedItem)`
* if you set the attribute `option-property` will be set as `selectedItem[propertyName]`
* otherwise it will be set as the full object


#### Options

option|meaning|accepted values|default
---|---|---|---
`options`|List of options to choose from|Array||
`options-expression`|The expression indicating how to enumerate a the options collection, of the format `variable in expression` – where variable is the user defined loop variable and expression is a scope expression giving the collection to enumerate. For example: `album in artist.albums or album in artist.albums | orderBy:'name'`.|expression||
`option-getter`|Optional method to get the value from the chosen item|function|not set|
`option-property`|Optional property name to get as model value from the chosen item|string|not set|
`modal-class`|The class for the modal (set on `<ion-modal-view>`|string|''
`selected-class`|The class applied to the currently selected option (if any) in the modal list|string|'option-selected'
`on-select`|Callback triggered on object select. Takes two arguments, `newValue` and `oldValue` with obvious meaning.|function call with arguments `newValue` and `oldValue`|not set
`on-reset`|Callback triggered when value is resetted using the relevant ui interface. Takes no arguments.|function call|not set
`modal-title`|The title shown on the modal header|string|'Select an option'
`header-footer-class`|The class for header and footer of the modal|string|'bar-stable'
`cancel-button`|Text of the button for closing the modal without changing the value|string|'Cancel'
`reset-button`|Text of the button for unsetting value in the modal dialog|string|'Reset'
`hide-reset`|Hides the button for unsetting value in the modal dialog|string. Set to 'true' for hiding the button|false
`use-collection-repeat`|Forces use of collection-repeat or ng-repeat for rendering options in the modal.| string "true", "false" | not set (automatically set according to number of options and `short-list-break` attribute)
`short-list-break`|The maximum number of item in list to be rendered with `ng-repeat`.(if `use-collection-repeat` is not set) If the list has a number of options greater than this attribute it will be rendered with ionic `collection-repeat` directive instead. (see also `load-list-message` option)|integer|10
`load-list-message`|Message to be shown when loading a long list of options in the modal|string|'Loading'
`has-search`|Whether to show a search bar to filter options.|set to "true" for showing the search bar|undefined
`search-placeholder`|String placeholder in search bar.|string|'Search'
`sub-header-class`|Class to be applied to the subheader containing the search bar (makes sense only if `has-search="true`) |string|'bar-stable'
`cancel-search-button`|Text for the button for clearing search text (makes sense only if `has-search="true`) |string|'Clear'
`clear-search-on-select`|Tells the directive to not clear the search bar content after user selection. Set to `false` to prevent clearing the search text.|boolean|true


### Passing in options

The `modal-select` directive must be provided with a set of options to choose from

This can be done in two ways:

* via the `options` attribute, that accepts an array of values or objects. The directive will watch for changes in this array and modify its options accordingly.
* via the `options-expression` attribute, that accepts an expression similar to what you would use with ionic `collection-repeat` directive, of the format `variable in expression` – where variable is the user defined loop variable and expression is a scope expression giving the collection to enumerate. For example: `album in artist.albums or album in artist.albums | orderBy:'name'`. This allows you to apply ordering or filtering without acting on the original array.


### Options templates

This directive expects to find a single inner element of class "option" that is used to define the template of the options that can be selected. Options will be rendered as items into a list in the modal (The content of each option, rendered with your template, is wrapped in an element of class 'item item-text wrap' and the original ".option" element is removed).

For example:
```html
<button class="button button-positive" modal-select ng-model="someModel" options="selectables" modal-title="Select a number">
    Select it
    <div class="option">
        {{option}}
    </div>
</button>
```

Will be rendered in the modal as :

```html
<div class="item item-text-wrap">
    {{option}}
</div>
```


## Search bar
From version 1.1.0 you can include a search bar into the modal for filtering options by simply adding the attribute `has-search="true"` to your `modal-select` element.

Filtering is implemented with the angular `filter` filter, which searches recursively in all properties of the objects passed in as options. This means that you cannot search on "computed properties" right now. For example if you are using a custom setter you will be only able to search the original properties of the options. 


### Examples
#### Simplest one.
This example shows a modal for choosing a number between 1 and 5.

In your controller:

```js
$scope.selectables = [1,2,3,4,5];
```
In your template:

```html
<button class="button button-positive" modal-select ng-model="someModel" options="selectables" modal-title="Select a number">
    Select it
    <div class="option">
        {{option}}
    </div>
</button>
```

#### Including a search bar
To include a search bar in the previous example, just add `has-search="true"`:

```html
<button class="button button-positive" modal-select ng-model="someModel" options="selectables" modal-title="Select a number" has-search="true">
    Select it
    <div class="option">
        {{option}}
    </div>
</button>
```



#### Objects as options
In the following example we use some objects as options.


In your controller:

```js
$scope.selectables = [
    { name: "Mauro", role : "navigator"},
    { name: "Silvia", role : "chef"},
    { name: "Merlino", role : "canaglia"}
];
```

We'll explore different possibilities we have with this options.

##### 1. Setting the full object

If we do not set `option-getter` or `option-property` attributes, the model is assigned to the full option object when an option is selected.

```html
<button class="button button-positive" modal-select ng-model="someModel" options="selectables" modal-title="Select a character">
    Select it
    <div class="option">
        {{option.name}} ({{option.role}})
    </div>
</button>
```




##### 2. Setting a property
If `option-property` attribute is set to a string, the bound model assigned that  property of the option object when an option is selected. For example if we set `option-getter="name"`, we get back the 'name' property of our options.

```html
<button class="button button-positive" modal-select ng-model="someModel" options="selectables" modal-title="Select a character" option-property="name">
    Select it
    <div class="option">
        {{option.name}} ({{option.role}})
    </div>
</button>
```

##### 3. Custom setter
If a function call is passed via `option-getter` attribute, the bound model assignment is done by calling this function with the selected option as the only argument (named 'option'). For example if we do this in our controller: 

```javascript
$scope.getOption = function(option){
    return option.name + ":" + option.role;
};
```

```html
<button class="button button-positive" modal-select ng-model="someModel" options="selectables" modal-title="Select a character" option-getter="getOption(option)">
    Select it
    <div class="option">
        {{option.name}} ({{option.role}})
    </div>
</button>
```

We get back the phrase "Mauro:navigator", "Silvia:chef" or "Merlino:canaglia" if we click the previous defined options.
